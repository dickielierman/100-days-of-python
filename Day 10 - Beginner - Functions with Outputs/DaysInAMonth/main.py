# Instructions
# In the starting code, you'll find the solution from the Leap Year challenge. First, convert this function is_leap() so that instead of printing "Leap year." or "Not leap year." it should return True if it is a leap year and return False if it is not a leap year.
#
# You are then going to create a function called days_in_month() which will take a year and a month as inputs, e.g.
#
# days_in_month(year=2022, month=2)
# And it will use this information to work out the number of days in the month, then return that as the output, e.g.:
#
# 28
# The List month_days contains the number of days in a month from January to December for a non-leap year. A leap year has 29 days in February.
#
# Hint
# Look at the function call at the bottom of the code to see the positional arguments. The order is very important.
#
# Feel free to choose your own parameter names.
#
# Remember that month_days is a List and Lists in Python start at position 0. So the number of days in January is month_days[0]
#
# Be careful with indentation.

# def my_input(text, restrictions=[]):
#     filtered = False
#     input_res = ''
#     while not filtered:
#         input_res = input(text).strip()
#         input_res_lower = input_res.lower()
#         if input_res_lower == '':
#             print("\nYou didn't enter any text.\n")
#         elif len(restrictions) > 0:
#             if input_res_lower not in restrictions:
#                 print(f'\nAnswers are restricted to the following: {restrictions}.\n')
